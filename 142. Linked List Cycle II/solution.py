## Floydâ€™s Cycle Finding Algorithm
## While traversing the linked list one of these things will occur-
##
##    The Fast pointer may reach the end (NULL) this shows that there is no loop in the linked list.
##    The Fast pointer again catches the slow pointer at some time therefore a loop exists in the linked list.
